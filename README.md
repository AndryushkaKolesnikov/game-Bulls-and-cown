About the game:

A well-known logic game. In it, you need to guess the number guessed by the computer. 
Each turn, you try any four-digit number. In response from the computer, you will get an answer about how many digits you guessed in the number you guessed. 
If the number in the hidden number is guessed and stands in its place-it is a bull, if not in its place - it is a cow.
